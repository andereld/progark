\section{Selection of Architectural Views}
We have chosen three different views from the "4+1 View Model", namely a logical view, a process view and a development view. We could have chosen a physical view as well, but the server is running in the cloud.

\subsection{Logical view}
\begin{description}
\item[Purpose] 
To translate the functional requirements into objects interacting and sending messages to each other. 

\item[Target audience]
Project Manager, Developer, ATAM evaluator, Course staff

\item[Notation]
Class diagram in UML, showing the main classes of the client and the server. 

\end{description}

\subsection{Process view}
\begin{description}
\item[Purpose] 
To present the dynamic aspects in the program like activities, states and tasks at run-time. 

\item[Target audience]
Project Manager, Developer, ATAM evaluator, Course staff

\item[Notation]
State diagram in UML.
\end{description}


\subsection{Development view}
\begin{description}
\item[Purpose] 
To give the developers an overview of the project, like how the modules and packages are organized. 

\item[Target audience]
Developer, Project Manager, ATAM evaluator, Course staff

\item[Notation]
Component diagram in UML.

\end{description}
