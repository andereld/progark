\section{Introduction}
This document describes the architectural requirements and tactics of the game \textit{Sea Battle} for Android by A7. The game is an implementation of the famous \textit{Battleship} board game, where two players can play against each other over the Internet. The players will take turns shooting each other's board. We will focus mainly on the networking part.  

The main architectural drivers are \textit{Modifiability} and \textit{Availability}.

The views we have included in this report are the \textit{Logical View}~\ref{logicalview}, the \textit{Process View}~\ref{processview} and the \textit{Development View}~\ref{developmentview} from the 4+1 View Model.
