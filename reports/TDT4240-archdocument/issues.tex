% Describe issues you faced working with and describing the architecture.

One issue we faced when describing our software architecture, is the logical separation of concerns between the client and server applications and its relation to the MVC pattern. We wish to implement the models and controllers server-side, and the view client-side, as is common with web applications. However, as the two applications are completely separate and only communicate over the Internet, there is a need for model-like objects (of deserialized data delivered over the network) on the client-side for the client application to construct its graphical presentation in a sensible way. There is also a need for controller-like event handlers in the client that trigger the appropriate HTTP requests. The group discussed whether this implies that we have a complete MVC architecture on the client-side alone. However, we found that as these ``models'' and ``controllers'' only mediate between the client's view and the \emph{actual} models and controllers on the server, they are an implementation detail rather than a complete MVC architecture. For example, the client's ``models'' are only deserialized JSON data, and do not contain the business logic of the server's models.
