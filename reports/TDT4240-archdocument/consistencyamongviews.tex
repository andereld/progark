\section{Consistency among views}
The state, class and component diagrams are consistent. We can see that the server components shown in the Logic and Development views are not shown in the Process view, but this is due to the nature of the diagrams, and what they aim to describe.

Regarding the differences between the component and class diagrams, the "GameLogic" component in the server component in figure \ref{fig:component} consists of most of the classes, matchmaking etc. from the class diagram for the server. The Express component simply takes the requests and calls methods and returns results based on the request.
