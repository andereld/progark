\section{Quality Requirements}
\subsection{Introduction}
In this section we'll define the quality requirements for the system: Which one will be our primary focus, and which one will be our secondary focus? An ideal world, all QA attributes would be heavily weighted in the development of a computer system, but as one has limited resources, one also has to limit oneself.
\newline
\newline
But what is a quality attribute? It is a measurable or testable property of a system \cite{progark, Side 63}. For instance a system can have high usability. One must have clear understanding of how the system can meet a requirement of high usability, before the system is developed.


\subsection{Quality requirement scenarios}
In this section we go through each of the quality requirments, starting with our primary and secondary quality requirement attributes.
